# AngularCSharpDockerTest

This repo was created to figure out how to run a C Sharp (Asp DotNet) backend and an Angular frontend via Docker-Compose.
It is not done yet.
It should be pointed out that the docker files use amd64 version of the node image for the frontend, the reason is because the file is tested on an AMD64 computer.
