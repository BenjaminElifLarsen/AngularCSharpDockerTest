# Angular CSharp Docker Test

This repo was created to figure out how to run a C Sharp (Asp DotNet) backend and an Angular frontend via Docker-Compose.
It is not done yet.
It should be pointed out that the docker file, for the frontend, uses amd64 version of the node image for the frontend, the reason is because the docker-compose is being tested on an AMD64 computer.

Current version is working.
Next thing will be to have images, that the docker-compose file is calling, instead of the projects themselves.
